                        <p>A shopper can be a gifter or vice versa. On SplitChek, shoppers choose whom they want to buy

                            is that kits and bundled products have a higher ranking when browsing as a gifter than a
                            shopper. If you are targeting gifters, package your products as kits or bundles that create
