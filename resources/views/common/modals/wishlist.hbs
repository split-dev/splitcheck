            <p>If you are familiar with some of these situations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Have you ever bought someone a thoughtful, meaningful gift after spending a considerable amount of
                time and energy, only to see a look of <span class="link-orange">disappointment</span> on their face
                when they open it?</li>
              <li>Have you ever wished for one significant and meaningful gift instead of several small and useless
                ones, but was too embarrassed to ask your friends and family to <span class="link-orange">share the
                  cost</span> and buy it for you as a group?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then using the wishlist will help your loved ones <span>choose the right gift</span> for you. Not
              everyone will see your list. You need to give permissions to groups or individuals whom you want to view
              or buy items from your wishlist.</p>
            <p>We will keep reminding you to update your wishlist so that you always get the right gifts.</p>
            <p>Don't forget â€“ SplitChek is a <span>social</span> gifting community. If your loved ones have a limited
              budget, SplitChek Community can help them out! Provided you have given them access to your wishlist.</p>
